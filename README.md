## Hackathon Project Idea (English)

**Short project idea:** We are building a real-time AI avatar assistant that can talk, understand emotions, react with expressions and animations, and improve safe human-AI interaction.

**Problem we want to solve on hackathon day:** Most AI chat tools are text-heavy and emotionally flat, and they often do not provide strong real-time safety response when user behavior becomes threatening.

**Proposed solution:**
- Use a live 3D VRM avatar with voice conversation to make communication natural and engaging.
- Add dynamic facial and body reactions so the assistant behavior matches the context.
- Integrate a safety pipeline that detects threats, captures evidence, and sends a Telegram report for fast moderation.
- Keep the system practical with model and animation optimization for fast loading and stable long sessions.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 **Neural "Rico" Persona**

- **Personality**: Sassy, high-energy, and business-minded. Rico isn't just an assistant; she's a "Cyber-Hustler" who demands tribute and roasts bad ideas.
- **Dynamic Response**: Responses are short, punchy, and emotionally charged.
- **Memory Core**: Remembers user details and past conversations across sessions.

### 🎨 **Quantum Visual Engine (v3)**

- **Holographic Environment**: Dual infinite grids (Floor & Ceiling) with a rotating vertical hyper-scanner.
- **VFX Layer**: "Digital Rain" particle system, chromatic aberration, and film grain for a cinematic look.
- **Audio Visualizer**: Simulated EQ bars that react to system states.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Premium dark-mode interface with "liquid glass" settings panels.

### 🎭 **Advanced Expression Engine**

- **Deep Emotion**: Expressions now have variable duration (3s - 10s) for lingering moods.
- **Micro-Expressions**: Subtle eye twitches and blinks to simulate life even when idle.
- **Full Range**: Supports a wide array of emotions: `smug`, `bored`, `disgust`, `excited`, `thinking`, and more.

### ⚡ **Performance Optimized**

- **Smart Caching**: VRM models and animations are cached in IndexedDB for instant loads.
- **Memory Management**: Aggressive garbage collection and resource disposal to prevent leaks during long sessions.
- **Dynamic Imports**: Code splitting ensures faster initial page loads.

### 🛡️ **Safety Layer**

- **Behavioral Reporting**: Integrated system to flag unsafe or inappropriate interactions for review.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Google Gemini API Key

## 🎮 Controls

- **Microphone**: Click the connection toggle to start a live voice session.
- **Camera**: Toggle vision to let Rico "see" you (Face tracking enabled).
- **Screen Share**: Show your screen for analysis.
- **Drag & Drop**: Drag any `.vrm` file into the window to swap your avatar instantly.

## New Functions (Latest Update)

### AnimationManager updates

- `getAnimationCatalog()` returns the full built-in animation list with names, paths, and loop settings.
- `loadAnimationFile(file)` loads one animation with local-first plus remote fallback support.
- `loadAnimationBatch(files, { onProgress, continueOnError })` loads multiple clips with progress callbacks.
- `startBackgroundAnimationLoad({ onProgress })` preloads remaining animations in the background.
- `initialize({ initialAnimations, loadRemainingInBackground, onBackgroundProgress })` supports staged startup loading.
- `triggerNamedAnimation(name)` now supports case-insensitive lookup and lazy loading from the catalog.
- `loadClipWithFallback(name, localPath, remoteUrl, isLoop)` retries animation loading from a backup source.

### Telegram relay updates

- `relayTelegramMethod(req, res, methodName)` now forwards both `GET` and `POST` Telegram Bot API calls.
- `buildQueryString(query)` serializes query params (including arrays) for Telegram `GET` methods.
- `readRequestBody(req)` safely forwards raw request payloads for multipart form-data and JSON requests.
